HABITat is a single-player game whose aim is to instruct people about how little practices can be useful to contribute against Climate change and its troubling effects. The game works with daily questions about users’ personal life and, based on answers, the result will show how user’s good practices are related with real troubles diagnosed by NASA’s project named FIREX-AQ. Besides that, information will be shown to warn the users about the seriousness of Climate Change problems and sharing on social media will be allowed.

In the future, the HABITat will be able to expose good examples of companies who invest and care about environmental education.
